Pranita was flexible, attentive and went over and above to make sure that I was able to meet a very tight schedule, despite having to deal with competing timelines from my formulation team. Pranitaâ€™s guidance and experience with pharmaceutical patents was paramount in ensuring that the final product was ready for application. I would absolutely recommend Pranita for anybody needing help with the patenting process, specifically as it relates to the pharmaceutical industry. I will be keeping her contact close for future guidance!">
