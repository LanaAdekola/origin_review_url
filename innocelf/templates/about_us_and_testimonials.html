            Hi, I am Pranita Dharmadhikari
          </h3>
          <p class="text-justify lato-regular">
            I started Innocelf, LLC with a mission to help inventors with intellectual property rights (IPR or IP)
            protection and propel them forward on their patent journey. Patent law can be convoluted with pioneer
            technologies or around an improvement on an existing technology. My mission for Innocelf, is therefore, to
            provide extensive and concentrated search results that will not only be useful in the grander patent process
            but will also help you understand the nuances of the patent process.

            <br>
            <br>

            I am committed to providing high quality patent research and opinions that will make it clear whether your
            idea is patentable or not. I will untangle some of those intricacies through the detailed and efficient
            reports you will receive. All inventions are unique and Innocelf with me will cater to those inventions at a
            personal level, yet encompass analysis from existing patents, licenses and products out there. I will make
            sure your idea does not infringe on others'. At Innocelf we use international patent and non-patent
            literature databases as well as some exclusive databases that help us in finding products that are not
            patented but are in production.


          </p>
          <p class="text-justify lato-regular">
            Before Innocelf, I have worked in a combination of pharmaceutical companies, law firms, research analytics
            firms and law clinics for ~7 years in different capacities related to patent research, drafting and
            prosecution. However, Innocelf targets only one aspect of these three avenues: patent research. Here, I have
            met amazing mentors who have and continue to better me in this profession.

            <br>
            <br>

            What led me into this profession was an invention I had developed in my sophomore year. I believed it had
            great value but did not know how to protect it back then. It would have been a help to the community if I
            had pursued patenting it and brought it into the public domain. Alas, the knowledge of such protections was
            not mentioned in my school. With Innocelf I want to provide this guidance to all inventors so they can
            achieve cost efficiency, transparency and make their inventions useful to the public while earning monetary
            or other benefits.

Pranitaâ€™s guidance and experience with pharmaceutical patents was paramount in ensuring that the final product was ready for application.
